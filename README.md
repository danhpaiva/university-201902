# University - Period 2019/02

### What will you find in this repository?

Here you will find Fundamentals of Web Development exercises. <br>
These are codes in <strong> Html, CSS and JavaScript </strong> that I made in the second half of 2019.
I decided to put all these codes here as a backup. <br>
If you encounter a similar problem, maybe I will help you to reason hehehe

All codes were made in the Portuguese language. If you can't read the language, you may not be able to understand the codes.

These codes were made from lists, and were carried out in an orderly manner.
I thank my professor Wesley Dias Maciel who gave me the exercises.

Perhaps I will return here in the future to redo some logic. ;)
